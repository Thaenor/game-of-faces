# game-of-faces
Web-app mobile implementation of the Game of Faces.

## The story:

First, thanks for taking an interested in this project. It's story is rather fun actually. It all started when me and a friend started sharing stories that might (or might not) have been lies... untill we realized we were playing the "game of faces" from Game of Thrones. 
  He started keeping score ("1-0"!). And I ased "How are going to keep track?" - that's when this idea came up.

    I quickly wrote this in about 2 hours using JQuery mobile.


## Do you wish to help:

Here's a couple of things I'd like to do:
* Reffactor the code a bit - Make it more object oriented
* Change the layout (looking at you Bootstrap)
* Make the save and load buttons work (I'm using localStorage but it's clearly not working out)
* ???

  PS: you can ignore the gh-pages branch. To be honest I wanted to keep this a secret but then I say "ahhh screw it!"

If you want to help feel free to clone the repo and make a pull request.
If you don't know how to code or just want to report a bug, you can do it by creating an issue.
